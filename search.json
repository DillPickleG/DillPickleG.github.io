    "section": "",
    "text": "Nebraska volleyball didn’t just get better in 2025. They transformed into something college volleyball hasn’t seen in years.\nThe Huskers entered this season with some concerns. After a 29-2 record in the regular season in 2024 and a losing championship match, would they be able to have what it takes to claim a national title this year? Although tournament play has just begun, Nebraska has made an almost-perfect rebuttal to last year’s mistakes. Through 30 matches, Nebraska hasn’t lost once. They’ve won 90 of 97 sets. They’re hitting .352 as a team, a number that dominates the rest of the nation.\nBut the improvement runs deeper than wins and losses. Individual players elevated their games. The offense became more efficient. The defense tightened. What was already an elite program improved across the board. Even though legendary coach John Cook handed over the reins to former Husker Dani Bushboom Kelly, Nebraska has held on to its top-caliber talent.\nThe numbers tell the story of a team that refused to settle for good enough.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nvb25 &lt;- c(\"Sets won\" = 90, \"Sets lost\" = 7, 6)\nvb24 &lt;- c(\"Sets won\" = 87, \"Sets lost\" = 16)\n\niron(\n waffle(vb25, \n        rows = 5, \n        colors = c(\"#000000\", \"#E41C38\",\"white\")) + \n   labs(\n     x=\"2025\",\n     title=\"Nebraska Volleyball Dominates sets in 2025\", \n     subtitle=\"The Huskers have lost just 7 sets this season after dropping 16 in 2024.

The Huskers lost 16 sets across 103 total sets played last season. This year, they’ve lost just seven sets through 97 total sets played. That represents a significant reduction in sets lost by more than half while playing a similar number of total sets.\nThe improvement suggests better execution in close situations. Sets that might have gone either way last season are breaking in Nebraska’s favor more consistently this year. Whether that’s due to better offensive decision-making or stronger defensive positioning isn’t clear from this data alone, but the outcome is measurable. It could also be that Nebraska is not facing as tough competition this year.\nThis type of consistency matters in tournament play, where a single lost set can shift momentum. Nebraska’s ability to avoid dropped sets gives them a statistical cushion that few other teams possess.\n\n\nCode\nplayers24 &lt;- read_csv(\"vb_per_set_data_2024.csv\")\nplayers25 &lt;- read_csv(\"vb_per_set_data_2025.csv\")\n\n\nallvbdata&lt;-bind_rows(players24,players25)\n\nallvbdatafiltered &lt;- allvbdata |&gt;\n  filter(Player != \"Merritt Beason (2024)\" &\n           Player != \"Lexi Rodriguez (2024)\" &\n           Player != \"Virginia Adriano (2025)\" &\n           Player != \"Teraya Sigler (2025)\" &\n           Player != \"Skyler Pierce (2025)\" &\n           Player != \"Manaia Ogbechie (2025)\" &\n           Player != \"Lindsay Krause (2024)\" &\n           Player != \"Leyla Blackwell (2024)\"&\n           Player != \"Kennedi Orr (2024)\" &\n           Player != \"Campbell Flynn (2025)\" &\n           Player != \"Allie Sczech (2025)\" \n)\n\nvblong &lt;- allvbdatafiltered |&gt;\n  select(Player, `K/S`, `SA/S`, `DIG/S`) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Player))|&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Player, names_to = \"stat\", values_to = \"total\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data = vblong, aes(x=Player, weight=total, fill = stat)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"#E41C38\",\"#c7c8ca\",\"#000000\"),\n    name=\"Per Set Stats\",\n    labels=c(\"Digs\",\"Kills\", \"Aces\")\n    )+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5,5.5,6,6.5,7))+\n  coord_flip()+\n    labs(\n    x=\"\", y =\"\",\n    title=\"Nearly Every Husker Improved in 2025\", \n    subtitle= \"Offensive upgrades from Allick, Jackson, and Murray on kills per set, combined with Choboy and \\nMauch's defensive surge on digs per set, create a more dominant volleyball squad.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Huskers.com | By Dillon Galloway\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10,face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10.9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual player improvements show up across the roster. Rebekah Allick increased her kills per set from 1.82 to 2.52, a 38% improvement. Andi Jackson went from 2.62 to 2.75 kills per set. Harper Murray raised her kills-per-set by .15 to approximately 3.55, continuing to provide consistent offensive output for this year.\nThe defensive numbers show similar gains. Laney Choboy improved from 1.53 to 2.74 digs per set, a 79% increase. Olivia Mauch went from 1.61 to 2.47 digs per set, a 53% improvement. This sudden change is most likely due to Coach DBK utilizing multiple liberos throughout games, unlike last year, when Lexi Rodriguez was the primary libero.\nWhat makes these improvements notable is their distribution across different position groups. The offense became more balanced with Allick’s increased production alongside Murray. The defense improved with both liberos increasing their dig totals. Bergen Reilly’s numbers remained relatively stable, suggesting the improvements came from the players finishing plays rather than from changes in setting distribution.\nThe effect of multiple players improving creates a more resilient team structure. Nebraska doesn’t rely as heavily on one or two players to carry the offensive load, and the defense has more depth to cover the court.\n\n\nCode\nteam24&lt;-read_csv(\"vbteams_2024.csv\")\nteam25&lt;-read_csv(\"vbteams_2025.csv\")\n\ntopconference24&lt;-team24|&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\" | conference == \"SEC\" | conference == \"ACC\" | conference == \"Big 12\" | conference == \"Big East\")\n\nneb24&lt;-team24|&gt;\n  filter(team == \"Nebraska\")\n\ntopconference25&lt;-team25|&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\" | conference == \"SEC\" | conference == \"ACC\" | conference == \"Big 12\" | conference == \"Big East\")\n\nneb25&lt;-team25|&gt;\n  filter(team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nbeeswarm24 &lt;-ggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=topconference24, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=hit_pct, y=conference), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=neb24, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=hit_pct, y= conference), color=\"#E41C38\",size=3)+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=neb24, \n    aes(x=hit_pct, y= conference, label=\"Nebraska\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(.15, .20, .25, .30, .35, .40), limits=c(.15, .4)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Hitting Percentage 2024\", y=\"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10,face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nbeeswarm25 &lt;-ggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=topconference25, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=hit_pct, y=conference), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=neb25, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=hit_pct, y= conference), color=\"red\",size=3)+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=neb25, \n    aes(x=hit_pct, y= conference, label=\"Nebraska\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(.15, .20, .25, .30, .35, .40), limits=c(.15, .4)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Hitting Percentage 2025\", y=\"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10,face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\nbeeswarm24 + beeswarm25 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"From Top-Level Offense to Best in the Nation\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska jumped from .284 to .352 in hitting percentage, to claim the #1 spot nationally by a notable margin.\",\n    caption = \"Source:  NCAA | By Dillon Galloway\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska’s team hitting percentage jumped from .284 in 2024 to .352 in 2025, a .068 improvement. That moved them from 11th nationally last season to first this season. For 2025, the gap between Nebraska and second-place Wisconsin (.317) is .035, which represents a significant difference between the two.\nTo put this into context, Pittsburgh led the nation at .332 in 2024. Nebraska’s current .352 mark exceeds last year’s national leader by .020. While most Power Five conference teams cluster between .200 and .300 in hitting percentage, Nebraska sits well above that range.\nThis improvement in hitting percentage most likely results from some combination of better shot selection, improved setting, reduced error rates, and more effective offensive schemes. Nebraska’s offensive efficiency puts them in a statistically distinct category from other top programs and past top performers. Whether this advantage persists in postseason competition against the nation’s best defensive teams remains to be tested, but the regular season data shows a measurable separation from the field."

    "text": "Dylan Raiola’s sophomore season tells two different stories. Nebraska fans watching games might think their young quarterback is struggling. The sack numbers look terrible, but anyone watching closely can see something else: a talented quarterback still developing, showing flashes of extraordinary athleticism, mixed with potential decision-making issues and/or a bad offensive line.\nThe question isn’t whether Raiola is good enough. The question is: How good could he be with absolute protection?\nLet’s look at the numbers from before his season-ending injury in Week 9 against USC.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nqbdata&lt;- read_csv(\"qbs2025.csv\")\n\ndylanraiola &lt;- qbdata|&gt;\n  filter(player==\"Dylan Raiola\")\n\nqb_pct&lt;-qbdata|&gt;\n  filter(passing_completions &gt;20)|&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\" | conference == \"SEC\" | conference == \"ACC\" | conference == \"Big 12\")\n\ntopqb_pct&lt;- qbdata|&gt;\n  filter(passing_completions &gt;20)|&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\" | conference == \"SEC\" | conference == \"ACC\" | conference == \"Big 12\")|&gt;\n  filter(passing_pct &gt;0.745)\n\n\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.728, color= \"blue\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=qb_pct, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=passing_pct, y=conference), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=topqb_pct, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=passing_pct, y=conference), color=\"black\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=dylanraiola, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=passing_pct, y= conference), color=\"red\",size=3)+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=dylanraiola, \n    aes(x=passing_pct, y= conference, label=\"Dylan Raiola\"))+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=topqb_pct, \n    aes(x=passing_pct, y= conference, label= player))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Completion Percentage\", y=\"Power Four Quarterbacks\", \n    title=\"Dylan Raiola Among the Power Four's Most Accurate Passers\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers' sophomore completes 72.8 percent of his passes, placing him near the top of the \\nBig Ten and ahead of nearly every quarterback in the SEC and Big 12.\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbfastR.sportsdataverse | By Dillon Galloway\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10,face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough nine games, Raiola’s accuracy stood out. The Huskers’ sophomore completed 72.8 percent of his passes, ranking fourth in the Big Ten behind Ohio State’s Julian Sayin, the passing completion leader. That put him among the top handful of quarterbacks across all Power Four conferences.\nLooking across the SEC, Big 12, and ACC, very few quarterbacks could match Raiola’s accuracy. He was more accurate than almost everyone, showing the kind of precision that separates good quarterbacks from great ones.\nThis was a quarterback with natural accuracy who consistently delivered the ball on target. The completion percentage showed what Nebraska has in Raiola, real talent that’s still developing but already producing at an elite level.\n\n\nCode\nqbs &lt;- read_csv(\"plays2025.csv\")\n\npowerfourEPA&lt;-qbs |&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\" | conference == \"SEC\" | conference == \"ACC\" | conference == \"Big 12\") |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"Pass\", play_type) == TRUE) |&gt; \n  group_by(pos_team, conference, passer_player_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    plays = n(),\n    total_EPA = sum(EPA, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(plays &gt; 100) |&gt; \n  mutate(position = \"QB\")|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_EPA))\n\ndylanraiola &lt;- powerfourEPA |&gt; \n  filter(passer_player_name == \"Dylan Raiola\")\n  \ntopqbs &lt;-powerfourEPA|&gt;\n  filter(plays &gt; 230)|&gt;\n  filter(total_EPA &gt; 100)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=powerfourEPA, \n    aes(x=total_EPA, y= plays), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=dylanraiola, \n    aes(x=total_EPA, y= plays), size= 3, color=\"#E41C38\")+\n  geom_point(\n    data=topqbs, \n    aes(x=total_EPA, y= plays), color=\"black\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=dylanraiola, \n    aes(x=total_EPA, y= plays, label=\"Dylan Raiola\"),size=4)+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=topqbs, \n    aes(x=total_EPA, y= plays, label= passer_player_name),size = 4)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=105, y=310, label=\"Top Quarterbacks\"), size = 6, color= \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Expected Points Added (Passing)\", y=\"Total Plays\", \n    title=\"Positive Passing Performance from Nebraska's Quarterback\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker quarterback has produced strong passing efficiency numbers that put him near the top of \\nPower Four conferences, despite attempting fewer passes than most high-volume starters\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbfastR.sportsdataverse | By Dillon Galloway\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10,face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaiola’s passing efficiency numbers backed up what the completion percentage showed. Despite attempting fewer passes than some of the Power Four’s highest-volume quarterbacks, he generated substantial combined Expected Points Added numbers over the nine games he played, which put him near the conference’s best.\nWhat stood out was how efficiently Raiola used his opportunities. He wasn’t getting the same volume as quarterbacks like Sawyer Robertson or Ty Simpson, but he was producing at a similar level. For a sophomore still learning the game, these numbers suggest significant potential.\nThe efficiency metrics revealed a player who’s starting to understand the game at a higher level. These are encouraging stats for a young quarterback’s development, proof that the talent is there and growing.\n\n\nCode\nqbdata&lt;- read_csv(\"qbs2025.csv\")\n\ntop15&lt;- qbdata|&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\" | conference == \"SEC\" | conference == \"ACC\" | conference == \"Big 12\")|&gt;\n  select(player, passing_td,passing_int)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(passing_td))|&gt;\n  top_n(15,wt=passing_td)\n\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=top15, \n    aes(y=reorder(player,passing_td), x=passing_td, xend=passing_int), size = 2,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=21, y=\"Dylan Raiola\", label=\"High TDs, Moderate INTs\"), color=\"blue\", size=3.7)+\n    labs(\n    x=\"Touchdowns vs Interceptions\", y =\"\",\n    title=\"Raiola's Interception Rate is Holding Him Back\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers' sophomore has thrown 17 touchdowns but also 6 interceptions, giving him a narrower \\nmargin between scores and turnovers than most productive Power Four quarterbacks.\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbfastR.sportsdataverse | By Dillon Galloway\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10,face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10.9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s where Raiola’s development shows room for growth. His 17 touchdowns and 6 interceptions through nine games created a smaller gap than the Power Four’s best quarterbacks. Compare him to Fernando Mendoza (24 TDs, 3 INTs) or Brendan Sorsby (19 TDs, 1 INT), and you see where Raiola still needs to improve.\nThe interception rate reveals what you might expect from a sophomore quarterback: occasional mistakes in decision-making and timing. Sometimes Raiola forced throws that weren’t there. Sometimes he didn’t recognize coverage quickly enough. These are correctable issues that come with experience.\nThe good news is that 17 touchdowns in nine games show real production. The interceptions aren’t totally alarming; it’s part of the learning process. As Raiola gains more experience reading defenses and understanding when to take risks versus when to play it safe, these numbers should improve. This is a work in progress, not a finished product.\n\n\nCode\nqbplays &lt;- read_csv(\"plays2025.csv\")\n\nqbsacked&lt;- qbplays |&gt;\n  filter(play_type == \"Sack\") |&gt;\n  filter(week &lt; 10) |&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\" | conference == \"SEC\" | conference == \"ACC\" | conference == \"Big 12\") |&gt;\n  filter(!str_detect(passer_player_name, \"Shotgun\"))|&gt;\n  group_by(pos_team, passer_player_name) |&gt;\n  tally(sort=TRUE)|&gt;\n  rename(\"Team\"=pos_team,\n         \"Player\"=passer_player_name,\n         \"Times Sacked\" = n)|&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |&gt;\n  relocate(Rank, .before = Team)|&gt;\n  top_n(-10,wt=Rank)\n\nqbsacked|&gt;\n  select(-Rank)|&gt;\n  gt()|&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Cornhuskers' Quarterback Leads Power Four in Sacks Taken\",\n    subtitle = \"With 24 sacks taken, the sophomore has hit the turf more than any other Power Four quarterback, suggesting the Nebraska quarterback is struggling with his offensive line or his own decison-making or a combination of both.\"\n  ) |&gt;  \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Dillon Galloway  |  **Source:** [cfbfastR](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/)\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(`Times Sacked`),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"white\", \"orange\", \"#E41C38\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCornhuskers' Quarterback Leads Power Four in Sacks Taken\n\n\nWith 24 sacks taken, the sophomore has hit the turf more than any other Power Four quarterback, suggesting the Nebraska quarterback is struggling with his offensive line or his own decison-making or a combination of both.\n\n\nTeam\nPlayer\nTimes Sacked\n\n\n\n\nNebraska\nDylan Raiola\n24\n\n\nAuburn\nJackson Arnold\n22\n\n\nIllinois\nLuke Altmyer\n22\n\n\nSouth Carolina\nLaNorris Sellers\n22\n\n\nMississippi State\nBlake Shapen\n17\n\n\nArizona State\nSam Leavitt\n16\n\n\nStanford\nBen Gulbranson\n16\n\n\nRutgers\nAthan Kaliakmanis\n15\n\n\nUCLA\nNico Iamaleava\n14\n\n\nArizona\nNoah Fifita\n13\n\n\n\nBy: Dillon Galloway | Source: cfbfastR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 24 sacks tell a complicated story. Through nine games before his injury against USC, Raiola was sacked more than any quarterback in the Power Four. Arnold, Altmyer, and Sellers each took 22 sacks, but Raiola stood alone at the top.\nThe sack number likely reflects multiple factors. Protection issues play a role, but so does Raiola’s own development as a quarterback. His pocket awareness and ability to scramble with the ball are lacking, leading to a high number of sacks. These are skills that can improve with experience and coaching. The high sack total is concerning, but it’s also part of the development process for a player still figuring out the speed of college football."
